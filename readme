Exercise on DOM

Add the following elements to the container using ONLY JavaScript and the DOM methods shown above:

a <p> with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
an <h3> with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
a <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
another <h1> that says “I’m in a div”
a <p> that says “ME TOO!”
Hint for this one: after creating the <div> with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container.

Code from JS exercise on learning DOM:

// learning DOM
// const p = document.createElement("p");
// p.textContent = "Hey I’m red!";
// document.body.appendChild(p);
// p.style.color = "red";

// const h3 = document.createElement("h3");
// h3.textContent = "I’m a blue h3!";
// document.body.appendChild(h3);
// h3.style.color = "blue";

// const divContainer = document.createElement("div");

// document.body.appendChild(divContainer);
// divContainer.style.border = "1px solid black";
// divContainer.style.background = "pink";

// const h1InDiv = document.createElement("h1");
// h1InDiv.textContent = "I'm in a div";

// const pInDiv = document.createElement("p");
// pInDiv.textContent = "ME TOO!";

// divContainer.appendChild(h1InDiv);
// divContainer.appendChild(pInDiv);

// document.body.appendChild(divContainer);

    Adding UI to game
    1. For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
    2. Create three buttons, one for each selection.
    Add an event listener to the buttons that call
    your playRound function with the correct
    playerSelection every time a button is clicked.
    (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
    3. Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
    4. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
    5. You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.
